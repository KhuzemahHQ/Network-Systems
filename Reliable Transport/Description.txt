Since the Network layer does not make any guarantees regarding the delivery of IP
packets, a reliable transport protocol is needed to ensure reliable delivery of packets. 

First, let's revise some of the issues that a reliable protocol needs to deal with, and their
remedies.
● Packet Loss. Packets may be lost on the Internet. Packets may get lost on the network,
by e.g. a router dropping incoming packets if it does not have sufficient available
buffer to store it.
Remedy: A reliable protocol’s receiver sends acknowledgments for received packets
back to the sender. In case of no acknowledgment within a timeout value, the sender
retransmits the packet.
● Packet Corruption. Factors such as noise/interference on the links can cause packets
to be corrupted.
Remedy: The sender appends a checksum value to each packet to detect corruption.
Upon receiving a packet, a receiver computes the packet’s checksum value and
compares it to the checksum value included in the packet. If they do not match, the
receiver will discard the packet and not send an acknowledgment for it.
● Reordering of Packets. There is a possibility that packets do not reach the receiver in
the same order as they were sent.
Remedy: The receiver uses the sequence of packets to find the correct order of incoming
packets.
● Duplicate Packets. Dealing with the packet losses can introduce another
problem—packet duplication. Packet retransmissions can cause a receiver to receive
the same packet more than once.
Remedy: The receiver sends an acknowledgment for the duplicate packet and does
nothing else as it already has a copy of the duplicate packet.
